# Purpose
Easy Saas project that allows users to uplaod a csv file and then incubate leads. 

1.  Stage 1 - Landing Page with email for a waitlisted type product.
* Goal - Get to 100 subs.
2. Stage 2 - Collect payment and build ad-hoc on make or n8n
* Goal - Get 10+ customers
3. Stage 3 - Build out Saas. 

##  Stage 1 Landing Page. 
**Context:** Design a sign up page for service that's about to launch.  This service will allow real estate agents to put their contacts in and have ai and clever automations stay in touch or "incubate" the leads for the agent.  Like "Happy Grasshoper" (a real estate service) but without the fluffy emails.  The landing page should allow the agent to add their email to sign up for an update when the service is ready. 

Style: Should be a dark theme in a "AI" style with blue or purple gradients. 
Layout:  The layout for the landing page should be pretty standard.
